# SG ID Boiler Plate Code
A code repository which provides boiler plate for a 3 tier app using SG ID authentication. 
Forked from https://github.com/rizvanJacob/sgidBoilerPlate

## Front End:
React (TS) frontend built using vite, tailwind, and daisyUI. 

Required env variables (.env file in ./client):
- VITE_SERVER_URL="your server url"
- VITE_AUTHORISE="set to true for deployment. set to false to bypass authorization during development"

## Server:
NodeJS (TS) server built using expressJS. Connects to a database using Prisma

Required env variables (.env file in ./server):
- DATABASE_URL="your database url"
- JWT_SECRET="a unique secret to sign and verify JWT tokens"
- LOGIN_REDIRECT_PATH="a url to direct clients after logging in using SG ID"
- AUTHORISE="set to true for deployment. set to false to bypass authorization during development"
- SGID_CLIENT_ID="retrieve from SGID Dev Portal"
- SGID_CLIENT_SECRET="retrieve from SGID Dev Portal"
- SGID_PRIVATE_KEY="retrieve from SGID Dev Portal"

## Database:
You will need to set up your own DB. Configure the server to communicate with your DB by amending ./server/prisma/schema.prisma. Add the database url to the server env files as shown above. 

For every new user that logs in via SGID, they must be manually approved by setting the "approved" column in "UserModel" to "t".
